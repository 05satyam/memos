* This project is a created to learn how to use heroku and deploy the python flask based rest api's to heroku as a web app.

* I have also used the **_CI tool_** provided by github under actions. 

* I have written the  basic unit test cases and under workflow directory **_.yaml_** file is designed to run the testcases

* Test cases will run as soon as commit is done to master branch.

* _Heroku_ auto-deployment has been setup which will run when **test coverage == 100%** .
